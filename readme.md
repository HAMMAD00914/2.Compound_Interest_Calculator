## Project Overview

The Compound Interest Calculator helps users understand how money grows over time with compound interest. It allows users to input the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency. The application then computes the total amount after the specified time.

This project is part of a series aimed at helping beginners become comfortable with the C programming language. Each project builds on the skills learned in the previous one, providing a structured learning path.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy navigation.
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts various parameters for principal, rate, time, and frequency.
- **Clear Output**: Displays results in a clear and concise manner.
- **Educational Value**: Helps users understand the concept of compound interest through practical application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Compound Interest Calculator, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HAMMAD00914/2.Compound_Interest_Calculator.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd 2.Compound_Interest_Calculator
```

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine. If you do not have one, you can download GCC or any other C compiler of your choice.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Use the following command to compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc -o compound_interest_calculator main.c
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: After compiling, run the program using the command:

   ```bash
   ./compound_interest_calculator
   ```

3. **Input Parameters**: Follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.

4. **View Results**: The program will display the total amount after the specified time, including the calculated interest.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The core language used for development.
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C code.
- **Makefile**: Optional for managing build processes (if included).
